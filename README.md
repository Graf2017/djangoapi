# djangoapi
This API is designed for an e-commerce platform, primarily focusing on backend functionality.
The project includes an integrated online payment system and order management features.
The system captures and stores the main characteristics and prices of products at the time of order creation,
effectively serving as a snapshot of the product description when the order is made. 

While the project requires refactoring, it is functional and can be deployed in its current state.
