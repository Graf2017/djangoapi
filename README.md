# djangoapi
This is an API for an e-commerce platform. The main focus is on the backend.
The order system was designed by me, but it may and will be modified in the future.
This system  allows to save the main characteristic and price at the time of order creation. 


If you want to see this project in action, a good option would be to use docker-compose.
